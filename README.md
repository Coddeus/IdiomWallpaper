# Idiom wallpaper generator
Generates wallpapers in one folder from a list of [idioms, meaning, usage]  
Just change this to whatever you want it to render

## Base specs

This is originally made : 
- for 1920x1080, BUT you can just change image size & reposition elements & resize font anyway

- for OS which support diaporama wallpaper (if you want it to change regularly), BUT you can add your own code to make it change automatically anyway

- for the English language, so you have to change the font in order to render other language systems (e.g. for Chinese proverbs)
